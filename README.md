# Checkers-AI

The purpose of this project is to explore and compare the performance of the Checkers-AI agent using either Alpha-Beta search or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The performance evaluation write-up is available <a href="https://github.com/dkhor2003/Checkers-AI/blob/main/Performance_Evaluation.pdf">here</a>.

To open up the game interface, run the `Checkers.java` script.
